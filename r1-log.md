The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 26, Saturday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Been working on my JavaScript development environment project to create a starter kit for JavaScript projects. I needed to have a quick way to be able to write modern JavaScript (so transpile with Babel) that had both dev and prod build pipelines with linting and testing baked in. The dev build needed to re-run the build including linting and tests for each files and the prod build should minify the code and handle browser caching by hashing the files.

Today I added a couple of packages, modified the webpack config to add source mapping and the html webpack plugin as well as adding an open:src script to abstract the transpiling of the src code and spinning up of the dev server to a separate script from the start.

Today I forked the 100-days-of-code repo so that I could complete my log. Also attended a local meetup for JavaScript juniors focused around React and Redux. The plan is split into groups to work together on a project using React and Redux.
